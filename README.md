# What's new
Firefox 57+ (WebExtensions Add-ons) can't edit browser appearance and only way is to edit files yourself, 
[I don't recommend use of Stylish anyway](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).

# Whirange-Fox
Very basic, clean, white skin with orange accent color for Firefox/Waterfox.

# Usage

    1. get userChrome.css: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindii/Whirange-Fox/master/userChrome.css
    
    2. Insert file to profile directory:
    Linux: ~/.waterfox/ PROFILID /chrome/userChrome.css
    Windows: C:\Users\ USERNAME \AppData\Roaming\Waterfox\Profiles\ PROFILEID \chrome\userChrome.css
	
    Note: Userid is random id and there is usually only one, also chrome folder dosen't exist yet so create it.

# Usage (Pre Firefox 57)
   EDIT: Just use Usage method, stylish is not safe, never was.

   ~~1. Download stylish from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/~~

   ~~2. Install from url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindii/Whirange-Fox/master/firefox.css~~
	
   ~~3. Optional styles~~

I did some testing on arch and windows and on both you need overall skin with white top element.

    Arch: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/deepin-gtk-theme/

    Windows 7: http://blademight.deviantart.com/art/Exon-by-BladeMight-648544389

Also on firefox you need to do some work, remove things you don't need with firefox customization option.
